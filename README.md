Abstract description like: 🚧 Zenflows is a software in **ALPHA stage** and is
part of the [REFLOW project](https://reflowproject.eu) that seeks to understand
and transform urban material flows, co-create and test regenerative solutions
at business, governance, and citizen levels to create a resilient circular
economy.

Our effort is is to develop circular and regenerative cities through the
re-localisation of production and the reconfiguration of material flows at
different scales, leveraging Fab Labs and makerspaces as catalysts for
wide-scale collaboration and co-creation conducive to systemic, sustainable
change.
